1. Step-back language/distancing language

**How**: 
Write the thoughts (that make you stressed) down. 
Start with the sentence with “I’m having thoughts that...”
Or “I’m noticing the thought that...”. 

**Why:**
Prepare yourself that this is a thought NOT a fact.

Create a safe distance between us and our thoughts so that we can see that thought for what it is. 

We don’t ignore these thoughts, but not taking them too seriously or sincerely.

2. Spin the Feelings Wheel

**How:** 
Ask ourself: 
(1). Which of these feelings am I experiencing right now? 
OR 
(2). Which of these feelings have I experienced over the last two weeks?

**Why:**
Being able to identify what the specific feeling or emotion actually is, and think why it happened may help to find better solutions. 

3. Early Warning Feelings

**How:** 
Notice the early feelings and open to them

**Why:** 
We could cope with these at an early stage.

4. Pause the Personalising

**How:** 
Remind ourselves that setbacks are part of life and there are many factors caused them.

**Why:** 
Personalising is a cognative bias that we assume things are our fault. It is a natural response because it is easy for us to focus on ourselves. However, it leads to unnecessary stress. 

5. Drop the Mental Filter

**How:** 
Remind to pay more attention to the positive things.

**Why:** 
Mental filter is cognative bias that our brain focuses on the negative things and filters down the positive ones. This is how our brain was developed for us to survive. But since we are not anymore fight for survive, this causes needless stress and anxiety.

6. Mindfulness Mental Muscle
